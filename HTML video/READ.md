## Embedding Videos Into a Webpage

I have added two files to this directory: an mp4 video, *"1 to 200 on Google Image Search"* and a simple webpage, *"main"*
that embeds the file.  I left a comment in which I discuss several attributes that can be speified in an HTML video 
element (autoplay the video, loop the video continuously, mute the video, show an image while the video is loading).  

The video file must be in the same directory (folder) as the html file.  If it is not, you will need
to change the src to include the appropriate file path.
